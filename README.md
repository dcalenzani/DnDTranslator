# DND Translator (v.1)
curl -u 'dcalenzani' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"AcaCrawler","description":"Crawler for academic databases"}'
I made this translator for a dnd spell book, but I guess it works for any kind of CSV, and with some refactoring maybe any table. 

Its a simple program, you input a csv file, you get a csv file translated. Right now you must pre-select the language.
